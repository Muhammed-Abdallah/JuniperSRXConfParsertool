# JuniperSRXConfParsertool

I developed this tool to Parse configuration files for SRX firewalls and Import the all the firewall configuration to database for more clear and concise format

this data can be used later for Firewall rules review or can be used for subnet migration, Subnet migration is tiddius task in the SRX firewalls

this tool had been developed in 2013, maybe is not compatiable with SRX firewalls anymore

Docs will be updated, Database schems will added here later
