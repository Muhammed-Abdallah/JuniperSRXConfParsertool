# JuniperSRXConfParsertool

I developed this tool to Parse configuration files for SRX firewalls and Import the all the firewall configuration to database for more clear and concise format

this data can be used later for Firewall rules review or can be used for subnet migration, Subnet migration is cumbersome task in the SRX firewalls

using this tool this task can been handled in few days instead of weeks

this tool had been developed in 2013, maybe is not compatible with SRX firewalls anymore

Docs will be updated, Database schema will added here later
